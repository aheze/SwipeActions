### Installation

SwipeActions is available via the [Swift Package Manager](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift_packages/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app). Alternatively, because SwipeActions is contained within a single file, drag [`SwipeActions.swift`](https://github.com/aheze/SwipeActions/blob/main/Sources/SwipeActions.swift) into your project. Requires iOS 14+.
